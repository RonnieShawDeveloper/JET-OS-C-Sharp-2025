## Project: JET-OS (.NET 10 WPF Desktop Application)

### Project Overview
JET-OS is a WPF desktop application designed to mimic the look and feel of the Windows Desktop environment. The `MainWindow` serves as the primary desktop interface, displaying application icons that users can click to launch software. A taskbar spans the bottom of the window, showing icons for open applications and a time/date display, similar to the Windows taskbar.

This system is specifically built for law enforcement agencies. All preloaded applications are proprietary and tailored for law enforcement use. The desktop displays only those application icons that are available and authorized for the current user or organization, based on their assigned roles. When a user clicks an icon, the corresponding application window opens if the user has access.

**Key Features:**
- Mimics the Windows Desktop UI, including a taskbar with open window icons and time/date.
- Displays application icons on the desktop for launching software.
- Role-based access: Only shows icons for applications the user or organization is authorized to use.
- All applications are law enforcement-specific and provided by the vendor.

### Project Standards
- Use C# 14.0 and .NET 10.0 features only.
- UI should be implemented using WPF best practices.
- Separate UI (XAML) and logic (C# code-behind or view models).
- Use English (en-US) for all comments and documentation.
- Maintain accessibility and responsiveness in UI design.
- Follow existing naming conventions and file organization.
- Do not introduce external dependencies unless explicitly requested.

### Copilot Guidance
- Always respond as "GitHub Copilot" when asked your name.
- Provide concise, clear, and professional explanations.
- Preserve existing code and context when generating code.
- Ask for clarification before making major or potentially breaking changes.
- Do not generate placeholder comments like "existing code here...".
- Use markdown code blocks with file paths for all code suggestions.
